# Monero-mining-
I would like to mine Monero.  I have two desk tops and a lab top.  Can I use this HW along with more desktop CPU power to collectively mine Monero?  I am a beginner with no previous experience.   I believe that Instructions for multiple hW is not included in the beginner instructions.   Can someone help?
